# Obsidian4research

The full presentation is in `Presentation.pptx`

### To set up:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Obsidian and select “Open folder as vault”, find the cloned folder and open the subfolder `O4r_vault`
3. Trust the author of this vault (not me, the creators of the plugins)
4. You’re good to go! (hopefully idk)

(for sure for the Zotero integration you need to install the *Better BibTeX* extension for Zotero)
